# Forensic Technical Expertise

## Technical Analysis in Judicial and Regulated Contexts

Clarity Structures applies software architecture expertise to
forensic technical analysis in environments where digital evidence,
traceability and system behavior must withstand scrutiny.

This work operates at the intersection of:

- Distributed systems
- Event-driven architectures
- Log reconstruction
- Audit trails
- Regulatory compliance
- Judicial evaluation

---

## Scope of Forensic Technical Work

### 1. System Reconstruction

Rebuilding the sequence of events in complex systems through:

- Immutable logs
- Event streams
- Deployment histories
- Version control metadata
- Infrastructure change records

Reconstructability is a design principle, not a post-incident patch.

---

### 2. Digital Evidence Integrity

Evaluation of:

- Log consistency
- Timestamp integrity
- Event ordering
- Data tampering indicators
- Chain-of-custody validation
- Systemic traceability gaps

Architecture determines whether evidence survives scrutiny.

---

### 3. Architectural Responsibility Analysis

Assessment of:

- Whether system design enabled or prevented risk
- Whether technical debt contributed to failure
- Whether traceability was intentionally or structurally absent
- Whether decision governance was documented

Technical ambiguity often originates in architectural opacity.

---

### 4. Peritaje Técnico en el Entorno Judicial Español

Aplicación de conocimiento arquitectónico en:

- Análisis pericial de sistemas distribuidos
- Validación de integridad de registros digitales
- Reconstrucción técnica de flujos de información
- Evaluación de custodia y trazabilidad de datos
- Identificación de deuda técnica relevante en litigio

El objetivo no es opinar.
Es demostrar técnicamente.

## Regulated and Investment Environments

Forensic-ready architecture is critical in:

- Financial platforms
- Healthcare systems
- Critical infrastructure
- Legal and compliance-heavy domains
- Investment due diligence scenarios

Systems not designed for traceability cannot be reconstructed reliably.

---

## Structural Position

Clarity Structures does not provide legal advice.

It provides:

- Technical clarity
- Architectural analysis
- Traceability evaluation
- Defensible system explanations

When digital systems are involved in conflict,
ambiguity becomes risk.

Engineering clarity reduces systemic risk.
